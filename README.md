# PianoPulse-MIDI-Piano-Javascript
PianoPulse is a fun and interactive MIDI piano project developed using JavaScript. It allows users to play piano notes directly from their computer keyboard, providing real-time visual feedback of the keys being played. The project aims to replicate the experience of playing a piano in a web browser.
