# PianoPulse

PianoPulse is a fun, interactive MIDI piano project developed using JavaScript. It is a web-based piano application that allows users to play piano notes using either their keyboard or touch events on mobile devices. The application is built using JavaScript, providing a responsive and interactive experience.


## üåü Features:
- **Interactive Keyboard**: Play piano notes right from your keyboard on pressing the keys.
- **Touch Support**: Play piano notes by touching the keys on mobile devices.
- **Visual Feedback**: See which keys you‚Äôre playing with real-time visual feedback.
- **Smooth Audio Playback**: Enjoy a seamless piano playing experience without much delay.
- **Responsive Design**: Supports both Laptop and Mobile screens and performs well.

## üé∂ How it works:
Simply press the keys on your keyboard, or touch the keys on your mobile device, and PianoPulse will play the corresponding piano note and show which key you pressed on the screen. It‚Äôs like having a mini piano at your fingertips!

The reason why I did this was, I just wanted to create something that reflects my love for both music and coding. PianoPulse was a fun way to experiment with JavaScript and bring a bit of music into the realm of developing web-based projects.
